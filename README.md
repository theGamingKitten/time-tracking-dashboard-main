## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

- That I can finish any challenge even if I need a longer break

### Continued development

- Focus more on getting the final product to look as close to the given design as possible. Had to rush this because I just wanted to finish this challenge after a long break and not give up

### Useful resources

- [Guide to CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - Needed to use this a lot in this challenge as I still struggle with grid layouts
